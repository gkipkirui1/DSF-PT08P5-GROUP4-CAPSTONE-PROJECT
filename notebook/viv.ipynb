    "According to INTERPOL's (2024) assessment, regions such as West and Southern Africa have seen an increase in romance baiting frauds, while Asia has become a focal point for telecommunication frauds where perpetrators impersonate law enforcement or bank officials to extract financial information from victims.Among financial institutions, commercial banks and health insurers have been notably affected by fraud. Additionally, identity fraud has emerged as a predominant threat, accounting for 45% of all adverse contributions reported by banks and financial service providers in 2023, with projections suggesting it could reach 50% by the end of the year,(Retain Banker International, 2024). Interpol (2024) states that causes of fraud in commercial banks and financial institutions are multifaceted. The increased use of technology has enabled organized crime groups to conduct sophisticated fraud campaigns at relatively low costs. Moreover, PYMNTS (2024) indicates the rise in scam-related frauds, particularly those exploiting consumer trust through social engineering, has led to a 56% increase in such incidents in 2024, surpassing traditional digital payment crimes. Regarding transaction methods, scams have become the leading form of fraud, surpassing digital payment fraud. The share of scam-related fraud increased by 56% in 2024, with financial losses from scams rising by 121%. These scams now account for 23% of all fraudulent transactions, with relationship and product scams responsible for most losses,(PYMNTS,2024). \n",

    "In Kenya, financial fraud has become an escalating concern, with recent incidents highlighting the vulnerability of the nation's financial institutions,(Kenay Wall Street,2024). A notable case involves Kiwipay Kenya Limited, where approximately Ksh2.3 billion ($19.48 million) was frozen due to suspicions of debit card fraud linked to an international syndicate. The CBK (2025) has identified several factors contributing to the rise of fraud within the country's financial sector. These include the increased adoption of information and communication technology (ICT), which, while enhancing operational efficiency, has also opened new avenues for cybercriminals. Additionally, a general lack of awareness regarding financial security among consumers has made them more susceptible to schemes such as social engineering and identity theft. Emerging cyber threats further exacerbate these challenges, necessitating robust cybersecurity measures across financial institutions. Among the various transaction methods, digital payment platforms have been significantly targeted by fraudsters. The CBK has observed that mobile and internet banking channels are particularly vulnerable, with fraudsters exploiting these platforms to conduct unauthorized transactions. This trend underscores the need for enhanced security protocols and increased consumer education to mitigate the risks associated with digital financial services."

    "## **Problem Statement**\n",
    "---\n",
    "The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has highlighted key risk factors, including the rapid adoption of digital financial services, low consumer awareness of financial security, and emerging cyber threats that continue to evolve. Furthermore, scam-related frauds, identity theft, and social engineering tactics have intensified, leading to substantial financial losses and undermining public trust in the financial sector. In response to these challenges, we aim to develop a robust fraud detection and prevention model that leverages advanced technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and real-time transaction monitoring. This model will enhance the ability of financial institutions to detect fraudulent activities proactively, mitigate risks, and strengthen cybersecurity measures. \n",
