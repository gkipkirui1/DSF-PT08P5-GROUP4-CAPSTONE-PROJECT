# ðŸ“ŒProject Overview 
---
According to INTERPOL (2024), fraud trends vary by region, with West and Southern Africa experiencing increased romance baiting scams, while Asia faces telecommunication fraud where criminals impersonate law enforcement or bank officials. Commercial banks and health insurers are the most affected financial institutions, with identity fraud accounting for 45% of reported cases in 2023 and projected to reach 50% by year-end (Retail Banker International, 2024). The growing use of technology has enabled sophisticated fraud schemes at lower costs, with scam-related frauds rising by 56% in 2024, surpassing digital payment fraud (PYMNTS, 2024). Scams now constitute 23% of fraudulent transactions, with relationship and product scams driving financial losses. In Kenya, financial fraud is escalating, exposing vulnerabilities in the banking sector (Kenyan Wall Street, 2024). A major case involved Kiwipay Kenya Limited, where Ksh2.3 billion ($19.48 million) was frozen due to suspected debit card fraud. The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK, 2025) attributes the surge in fraud to increased ICT adoption, low financial security awareness, and emerging cyber threats. Mobile and internet banking channels remain highly targeted, emphasizing the need for stronger security protocols and public education to combat digital financial fraud.

Kenya has experienced a massive shift to digital banking and mobile transactions, with platforms like M-Pesa, PesaLink, and internet banking becoming dominant. However, this digitization has also led to an increase in financial fraud cases, such as:

* ATM and Card Fraud: Criminals use card skimming devices to steal customer information.
* SIM Swap Fraud: Fraudsters gain control of a victimâ€™s SIM card to access mobile banking accounts.
* Social Engineering Attacks: Scammers impersonate banks to trick customers into revealing sensitive information.
* Account Takeovers: Unauthorized individuals gain access to banking credentials and conduct fraudulent transactions.
  
In Kenya, several fraud cases have made headlines, including:

* KCB Bank SIM Swap Scam (2021) â€“ Customers lost millions after fraudsters illegally swapped SIM cards to gain access to their mobile banking.
* Equity Bank Card Cloning (2022) â€“ A group of criminals was arrested for skimming debit card details from unsuspecting users.
* M-Pesa Fraud Rings (2023) â€“ Multiple fraud cases involved con artists deceiving individuals into sending money via M-Pesa through fake job offers and lottery scams.
  
To combat these threats, banks need an intelligent, adaptive fraud detection system that can identify fraudulent transactions in real time while minimizing false alarms.

# ðŸ“ŒBusiness Problem 
---
The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has highlighted key risk factors, including the rapid adoption of digital financial services, low consumer awareness of financial security, and emerging cyber threats that continue to evolve. Furthermore, scam-related frauds, identity theft, and card skimming have intensified, leading to substantial financial losses and undermining public trust in the financial sector. In response to these challenges, we aim to develop a robust fraud detection and prevention model that leverages advanced technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and real-time transaction monitoring. This model will enhance the ability of financial institutions in Kenya to detect fraudulent activities proactively, mitigate risks, and strengthen cybersecurity measures ensuring real-time fraud prevention and minimizing financial losses.

## ðŸ“ŒProject Objectives
---
1. Classify whether a transactions is fraudulent or non-fraudulent using patterns from historical data

2. Identify unusual transactions patterns that may signal fraudulent activities, checking for outliers within the transactions.

3. Train machine learning model which predicts fraudulent transactions based on historical data.

4. Study how demographics including age and gender impact fraud risks.

5. Identify peak fraud periods based on transactions date and transactions time.


# ðŸ“ŒData Source and Description 
---
The data was sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marusagar/bank-transaction-fraud-detection

The dataset used for model building contained 200000 observations of 24 variables. 

The variables in the dataset are *Customer_ID*, *Customer_Name*, *Gender* , *Age* ,*State*, *City*, *Bank_Branch*, *Account_Type*, *Transaction_ID*, *Transaction_Date*, *Transaction_Time*, *Transaction_Amount*, *Merchant_ID*, *Transaction_Type*, *Merchant_Category*, *Account_Balance*, *Transaction_Device*, * Transaction_Location*, *Device_Type*, *Is_Fraud*, *Transaction_Currency*, *Customer_Contact*, *Transaction_Description* and *Customer_Email*
