# Background Study of Fraud 

According to INTERPOL's (2024) assessment, regions such as West and Southern Africa have seen an increase in romance baiting frauds, while Asia has become a focal point for telecommunication frauds where perpetrators impersonate law enforcement or bank officials to extract financial information from victims.Among financial institutions, commercial banks and health insurers have been notably affected by fraud. Additionally, identity fraud has emerged as a predominant threat, accounting for 45% of all adverse contributions reported by banks and financial service providers in 2023, with projections suggesting it could reach 50% by the end of the year,(Retain Banker International, 2024). Interpol (2024) states that causes of fraud in commercial banks and financial institutions are multifaceted. The increased use of technology has enabled organized crime groups to conduct sophisticated fraud campaigns at relatively low costs. Moreover, PYMNTS (2024) indicates the rise in scam-related frauds, particularly those exploiting consumer trust through social engineering, has led to a 56% increase in such incidents in 2024, surpassing traditional digital payment crimes. Regarding transaction methods, scams have become the leading form of fraud, surpassing digital payment fraud. The share of scam-related fraud increased by 56% in 2024, with financial losses from scams rising by 121%. These scams now account for 23% of all fraudulent transactions, with relationship and product scams responsible for most losses,(PYMNTS,2024).
